# Memory Bank - Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure

## Task 1.1: Project Scaffolding

---
**Agent:** Setup Specialist
**Task Reference:** Phase 1 / Task 1.1 / Project Scaffolding

**Summary:**
Successfully completed the complete project scaffolding for the BackChannel plugin, establishing the foundational infrastructure including TypeScript/Vite build system, testing framework, linting configuration, and initial project structure.

**Details:**
- Initialized yarn project with proper package.json configuration for BackChannel plugin
- Configured TypeScript with ES2015 target and strict mode for ES5-compatible output
- Set up Vite build system with IIFE format for single-file plugin output (dist/backchannel.js)
- Implemented ESLint with TypeScript support and Prettier integration using flat config format
- Created comprehensive project directory structure (src/{components,utils,services,types}, tests/{unit,e2e})
- Configured Vitest for unit testing with jsdom environment and Playwright for integration testing
- Created root-level index.html with welcome content and plugin initialization demo
- Implemented initial plugin entry point (src/index.ts) with global window.BackChannel API
- Set up husky pre-commit hooks to run linting and tests before commits
- Created comprehensive unit and integration tests verifying plugin initialization and API functionality

**Output/Result:**
```typescript
// Core plugin structure in src/index.ts
class BackChannelPlugin {
  private config: PluginConfig;
  private state: FeedbackState;

  init(config: PluginConfig = {}): void {
    this.config = {
      requireInitials: false,
      storageKey: 'backchannel-feedback',
      targetSelector: '.reviewable',
      allowExport: true,
      ...config,
    };
    this.setupEventListeners();
  }
}

// Global API exposure
window.BackChannel = {
  init: (config?: PluginConfig) => backChannelInstance.init(config),
  getState: () => backChannelInstance.getState(),
  getConfig: () => backChannelInstance.getConfig(),
};
```

Build output: dist/backchannel.js (1.51 kB, unminified with source maps)
Test results: All 5 unit tests passing, including plugin initialization and configuration tests
Pre-commit hooks: Successfully configured to run lint and test commands

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None

**Next Steps:**
Project foundation is ready for Phase 2 implementation. The build system successfully generates the single-file plugin output as required, and all tests are passing. Ready to proceed with Task 1.2: Core Types & Interfaces implementation.
