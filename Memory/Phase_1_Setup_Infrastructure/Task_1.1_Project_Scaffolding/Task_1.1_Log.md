**Agent:** Implementation Agent (Setup Specialist)
**Task Reference:** Phase 1 / Task 1.1: Project Scaffolding

**Summary:**
Successfully completed project scaffolding for BackChannel, establishing the development environment, build process, and core architecture with all required configurations and initial tests.

**Details:**

- Initialized project with yarn and configured package.json with appropriate metadata
- Set up TypeScript with tsconfig.json configured for ES5-compatible output
- Configured Vite for UMD/IIFE format to generate a single JavaScript file output
- Established ESLint and Prettier with appropriate rules (single quotes for JS strings)
- Created project directory structure with src/ directory and appropriate subdirectories
- Set up build process for single-file output with source maps
- Configured Jest for unit testing and Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Created root-level index.html with welcome content for testing
- Implemented initial tests for the welcome page
- Configured Husky with pre-commit and pre-push hooks for code quality:
  - Pre-commit: lint-staged (formatting and linting changed files) + unit tests
  - Pre-push: end-to-end tests

**Output/Result:**
The project structure has been established with all necessary configuration files:

```
/
├── .eslintrc.js          # ESLint configuration
├── .husky/               # Git hooks directory
│   ├── pre-commit        # Runs lint-staged and unit tests
│   └── pre-push          # Runs E2E tests
├── .prettierrc           # Prettier configuration
├── index.html            # Root-level welcome page
├── jest.config.js        # Jest configuration for unit tests
├── package.json          # Project metadata and dependencies
├── playwright.config.ts  # Playwright configuration for E2E tests
├── src/                  # Source code directory
│   ├── index.ts          # Main entry point
│   └── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
├── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
└── vite.config.js        # Vite build configuration
```

Key configuration snippets:

1. Package.json scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "build-plugin": "vite build",
  "test": "jest",
  "test:e2e": "playwright test",
  "lint": "eslint src --ext .ts",
  "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\""
}
```

2. Husky pre-commit hook:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

yarn lint-staged && yarn test
```

3. Husky pre-push hook:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

yarn test:e2e
```

4. lint-staged configuration in package.json:

```json
"lint-staged": {
  "*.{ts,tsx}": [
    "prettier --write",
    "eslint"
  ]
}
```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None. All TypeScript linting errors were identified and fixed.

**Next Steps:**
Ready to proceed with implementing the core plugin functionality as per the Implementation Plan.
