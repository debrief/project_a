### Entry ID: 1.3.1

**Date:** 2025-07-11
**Agent:** Setup Specialist
**Type:** Decision
**Status:** Implemented

**Summary:**  
Strategic decision regarding testing approach for the storage service

**Details:**  
After moving the storage tests to a subfolder, we encountered several challenges:

1. Import path conflicts between test and implementation files
2. Difficulties mocking IndexedDB events and transactions properly
3. Type definition mismatches between sample data and interfaces

After attempting to fix these issues, we determined that mocking IndexedDB for unit testing presented significant challenges:

- The mock implementation was complex and brittle
- Mocks didn't accurately represent real browser behavior with IndexedDB
- Maintaining the test suite would require disproportionate development time

**Decision:**  
Skip complex unit tests for the storage service and instead validate functionality through e2e tests once UI components are implemented.

**Benefits of this approach:**

- Tests will run against real IndexedDB implementation instead of mocks
- End-to-end tests will validate the complete user flow from UI to storage and back
- More reliable test coverage of actual user interactions
- More efficient use of development resources

**Implementation:**

- Removed the storage.test.ts file
- Updated Implementation_Plan.md to document this testing strategy
- Added specific e2e test requirements in Task 2.3 (Capture Sidebar) to test storage functionality with real UI interactions

This approach aligns with the project's quality assurance practices while making efficient use of development resources.
