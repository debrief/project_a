# Memory Bank Entry: Task 1.2 - Core Types & Interfaces

## Summary

Successfully implemented the core TypeScript interfaces and types for the BackChannel plugin as specified in Task 1.2 of the Implementation Plan. Created comprehensive type definitions for comments, feedback packages, page metadata, and plugin configuration. Added enums for feedback states and plugin modes. All types are properly documented with JSDoc comments and organized in a central types directory with appropriate exports.

## Details

### Implementation Approach

1. Created a central `/src/types/index.ts` file to contain all core interfaces and enums
2. Defined the following types with comprehensive JSDoc documentation:
   - `FeedbackState` enum for comment states (New, Acknowledged, Resolved)
   - `PluginMode` enum for plugin modes (Capture, Review)
   - `PageMetadata` interface for page information
   - `Comment` interface for feedback comments
   - `FeedbackPackage` interface for collections of comments
   - Enhanced `BackChannelConfig` interface with additional configuration options
3. Updated references in the main plugin code to use the new types
4. Created unit tests to verify the types work as expected
5. Fixed linting issues to ensure code quality

### Code Changes

**1. Created `/src/types/index.ts` with all core interfaces and enums:**

```typescript
/**
 * Core types and interfaces for the BackChannel plugin
 */

/**
 * Represents the state of a feedback comment
 */
export enum FeedbackState {
  /** New comment that hasn't been reviewed */
  New = 'new',
  /** Comment that has been viewed but not resolved */
  Acknowledged = 'acknowledged',
  /** Comment that has been addressed and resolved */
  Resolved = 'resolved',
}

/**
 * Represents the operational mode of the BackChannel plugin
 */
export enum PluginMode {
  /** Mode for capturing and submitting feedback */
  Capture = 'capture',
  /** Mode for reviewing and managing feedback */
  Review = 'review',
}

/**
 * Represents metadata about the page being commented on
 */
export interface PageMetadata {
  /** The URL of the page */
  url: string
  /** The title of the page */
  title: string
  /** Timestamp when the page was accessed */
  timestamp: number
  /** Any additional page-specific metadata */
  additionalInfo?: Record<string, unknown>
}

/**
 * Represents a single feedback comment
 */
export interface Comment {
  /** Unique identifier for the comment */
  id: string
  /** The actual comment text */
  text: string
  /** The author of the comment (typically initials or name) */
  author: string
  /** Timestamp when the comment was created */
  timestamp: number
  /** CSS selector to identify the commented element */
  elementSelector: string
  /** The current state of the comment */
  state: FeedbackState
  /** Optional screenshot or visual reference (base64 encoded) */
  screenshot?: string
  /** Reference to the page where the comment was made */
  pageMetadata: PageMetadata
}

/**
 * Represents a collection of feedback comments
 */
export interface FeedbackPackage {
  /** Unique identifier for the package */
  id: string
  /** Title of the feedback package */
  title: string
  /** Author or creator of the feedback package */
  author: string
  /** Timestamp when the package was created */
  createdAt: number
  /** Timestamp when the package was last modified */
  updatedAt: number
  /** Collection of comments in this package */
  comments: Comment[]
  /** Any additional metadata for the package */
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>
}

/**
 * Configuration options for the BackChannel plugin
 */
export interface BackChannelConfig {
  /** CSS selector for elements that can receive feedback (default: '.reviewable') */
  targetSelector?: string
  /** Whether to require initials when submitting feedback (default: true) */
  requireInitials?: boolean
  /** Whether to allow exporting feedback as CSV (default: true) */
  allowExport?: boolean
  /** Key used for localStorage caching (default: 'backchannel') */
  storageKey?: string
  /** Initial plugin mode (default: PluginMode.Capture) */
  initialMode?: PluginMode
  /** Whether to show the plugin icon on load (default: true) */
  showIconOnLoad?: boolean
  /** Position of the BackChannel icon (default: 'top-right') */
  iconPosition?: 'top-right' | 'top-left' | 'bottom-right' | 'bottom-left'
}
```

**2. Updated `/src/index.ts` to import and use the new types:**

```typescript
// Import types
import { BackChannelConfig, PluginMode } from './types'

// Updated constructor with new default values
constructor(config: BackChannelConfig = {}) {
  this.config = {
    targetSelector: '.reviewable',
    requireInitials: true,
    allowExport: true,
    storageKey: 'backchannel',
    initialMode: PluginMode.Capture,
    showIconOnLoad: true,
    iconPosition: 'top-right',
    ...config,
  }
}
```

**3. Updated `/src/types/global.d.ts` to reference the types from the new location:**

```typescript
import { BackChannelConfig } from './index'
import BackChannel from '../index'
```

**4. Created unit tests for the new types in `/tests/types.test.ts`**

## Outputs

1. All linting and TypeScript checks pass:

   ```
   $ yarn lint
   ✨  Done in 0.93s.

   $ yarn tsc --noEmit
   ✨  Done in 1.42s.
   ```

2. Unit tests pass:

   ```
   $ yarn test
   PASS  tests/types.test.ts
   PASS  src/tests/index.test.ts

   Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
   Tests:       7 passed, 7 total
   ```

3. Build completes successfully:
   ```
   $ yarn build
   ✓ built in 59ms
   ```

## Status

✅ **Complete**

The implementation of core types and interfaces is complete. All required interfaces and enums have been created with comprehensive JSDoc documentation. The types are organized in a central location for easy importing, and all code references have been updated to use the new types. Unit tests have been added to verify the types work as expected.

## Issues and Challenges

No significant issues were encountered during implementation. The task was completed successfully with all requirements met.

## Next Steps

1. Proceed to Task 1.3: Storage Service Implementation
2. Ensure the Storage Service uses the newly defined types for data persistence
3. Update any existing code to leverage the type system for improved safety and documentation
