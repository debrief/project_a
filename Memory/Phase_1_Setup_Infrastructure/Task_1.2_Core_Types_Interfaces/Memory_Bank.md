# Memory Bank - Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure

## Task 1.2: Core Types & Interfaces

---
**Agent:** Setup Specialist
**Task Reference:** Phase 1 / Task 1.2 / Core Types & Interfaces

**Summary:**
Successfully re-implemented TypeScript interfaces and types for the BackChannel application with minimal complexity, focusing strictly on the software requirements and persistence schema defined in docs/project/persistence.md to avoid over-engineering.

**Details:**
- Analyzed software requirements and persistence schema to identify minimum necessary types
- Created CaptureComment interface matching persistence schema: id, text, pageUrl, timestamp, location, optional snippet, optional author
- Implemented ReviewComment interface extending CaptureComment with review-specific fields: state, editorNotes, reviewedBy, reviewedAt
- Added CommentState enum for review workflow: OPEN, ACCEPTED, REJECTED, RESOLVED
- Defined DocumentMetadata interface for IndexedDB storage: documentTitle, documentRootUrl, optional documentId, optional reviewer
- Simplified PluginConfig interface with only necessary options: requireInitials, storageKey, targetSelector, allowExport, debugMode
- Created CSVExportData interface for export functionality
- Implemented StorageInterface aligned with persistence requirements
- Added minimal type guards (isCaptureComment, isReviewComment) for runtime validation
- Created utility types: NewComment, CommentUpdate for development convenience
- Removed unnecessary complexity: themes, events, complex metadata, priority levels, extensive configuration options
- Updated plugin code to use simplified types with URL-based storage key generation
- Enhanced plugin initialization with streamlined configuration

**Output/Result:**
```typescript
// Minimal CaptureComment interface matching persistence schema
export interface CaptureComment {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  pageUrl: string;
  timestamp: string;
  location: string;
  snippet?: string;
  author?: string;
}

// ReviewComment extends CaptureComment for review mode
export interface ReviewComment extends CaptureComment {
  state: CommentState;
  editorNotes?: string;
  reviewedBy?: string;
  reviewedAt?: string;
}

// Comment states for review workflow
export enum CommentState {
  OPEN = 'open',
  ACCEPTED = 'accepted',
  REJECTED = 'rejected',
  RESOLVED = 'resolved',
}

// Simplified PluginConfig with only necessary options
export interface PluginConfig {
  requireInitials?: boolean;
  storageKey?: string;
  targetSelector?: string;
  allowExport?: boolean;
  debugMode?: boolean;
}

// URL-based storage key generation
private generateStorageKey(): string {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location) {
    const url = new URL(window.location.href);
    return `backchannel-${url.hostname}${url.pathname}`;
  }
  return 'backchannel-feedback';
}
```

Total interfaces created: 5 (CaptureComment, ReviewComment, DocumentMetadata, PluginConfig, CSVExportData, StorageInterface)
Total enums created: 2 (FeedbackState, CommentState)
Total utility types created: 2 (NewComment, CommentUpdate)
Total type guards created: 2 (isCaptureComment, isReviewComment)

Build output: Updated dist/backchannel.js (2.39 kB, similar size with simplified types)
Test results: All 5 unit tests passing with enhanced type checking
Linting: All code passes ESLint with no warnings - type guards use `unknown` type instead of `any` for proper type safety

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None

**Next Steps:**
Type definitions are now appropriately scoped and ready for Task 1.3: Storage Service Implementation. The simplified interfaces provide strong type safety for both capture and review modes while maintaining minimal complexity. The StorageInterface directly supports the IndexedDB persistence requirements and CSV export/import functionality as specified in the technical documentation.
