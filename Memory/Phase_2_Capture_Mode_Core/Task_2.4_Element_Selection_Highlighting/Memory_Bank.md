**Agent:** Implementation Agent
**Task Reference:** Task 2.4: Element Selection & Highlighting

**Summary:**
Successfully completed comprehensive enhancements to the element selection and highlighting system. Built upon the existing implementation from Task 2.3 to add performance optimizations, advanced keyboard navigation, enhanced accessibility, and robust element identification. All functionality tested and validated with no regressions.

**Details:**
**Action Step 1 - Enhanced Hover Highlighting:**
- Added passive event listeners for improved performance (mouseover/mouseout with { passive: true })
- Enhanced `findBestElementToHighlight()` method with intelligent element selection logic
- Added `selectableElements` array to prevent over-traversal for list items, table elements, and form controls
- Improved `shouldIgnoreElement()` filtering to include hidden/invisible elements and more non-content tags
- Added smooth CSS animations with 0.15s transitions
- Implemented intelligent tooltip positioning with `positionTooltip()` method
- Added responsive design and accessibility support (high contrast, reduced motion)

**Action Step 2 - Refined Click Handling:**
- Added click debouncing with 100ms timeout to prevent rapid/double clicks
- Enhanced event propagation handling (preventDefault, stopPropagation)
- Improved element selection logic using `findBestElementToHighlight()` for consistency
- Added proper cleanup of click timeouts in `disableElementSelection()`
- Implemented click timeout property to track pending selections

**Action Step 3 - Enhanced Element Identification:**
- Completely rebuilt `getXPath()` method with enhanced specificity (IDs, classes, sibling positioning)
- Added new `getCSSSelector()` method for alternative element targeting
- Enhanced `getElementInfo()` return object with cssSelector, elementIndex, and parentInfo
- Added helper methods: `getElementIndex()`, `getParentInfo()`, `getCSSSelector()`
- Improved XPath generation to stop at unique IDs and use class-based selectors

**Action Step 4 - Optimized Cancel Functionality:**
- Enhanced cancel button styling with better accessibility and visual design
- Added comprehensive keyboard support (Enter, Space, Tab navigation)
- Implemented hover effects with smooth transitions and box shadows
- Added focus/blur handlers with proper outline management
- Added debounced click handling and auto-focus for keyboard accessibility
- Updated button text to "Cancel selection (Esc)" for better user guidance

**Action Step 5 - Advanced Keyboard Navigation:**
- Added arrow key navigation between elements with directional traversal
- Implemented Enter key for element selection of currently highlighted element
- Added Ctrl+H for contextual help popup with keyboard shortcuts
- Enhanced Tab navigation to cancel button with proper focus management
- Added `navigateToNextElement()` and `findElementInDirection()` methods
- Implemented `scrollElementIntoView()` for smooth element navigation
- Added `showKeyboardHelp()` with temporary help popup display

**Bug Fix - List Item Selection Issue:**
- Fixed issue where individual list items (`<li>`) were being bypassed in favor of parent `<ol>`/`<ul>` elements
- Enhanced `findBestElementToHighlight()` to prioritize selectable elements (LI, TR, TD, P, H1-H6, etc.)
- Added early return for elements that should be selectable at their own level
- Maintained intelligent parent-finding logic for inline elements while preserving granular selection

**Output/Result:**
```typescript
// Key enhancements added to BackChannelPlugin:
// Performance optimizations:
// - Passive event listeners for better scroll performance
// - Debounced click handling to prevent rapid selections
// - Event delegation for efficient DOM event management

// Enhanced element identification:
// - Robust XPath generation with ID/class specificity
// - CSS selector generation for alternative targeting
// - Element index and parent info for comprehensive identification

// Advanced keyboard navigation:
// - Arrow keys for directional element traversal
// - Enter key for selection, Escape for cancel
// - Ctrl+H for contextual help display
// - Tab navigation with proper focus management

// Accessibility improvements:
// - ARIA labels and proper tabindex management
// - High contrast and reduced motion support
// - Keyboard-only navigation capabilities
// - Focus indicators and screen reader compatibility

// Visual enhancements:
// - Smooth CSS transitions and animations
// - Intelligent tooltip positioning
// - Responsive design for mobile devices
// - Enhanced color schemes and hover effects
```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
