# APM Task Assignment: Storage Service Implementation

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the BackChannel project. As an Implementation Agent, your role is to execute the assigned task diligently and log your work meticulously.

BackChannel is a lightweight JavaScript plugin for capturing and reviewing feedback on static web content, designed for offline or air-gapped environments in military settings. It supports feedback workflows across single and multi-page document sets.

Your work will be reviewed by the Manager Agent (via the User) and stored in the Memory Bank for project continuity. The quality and completeness of your implementation are critical to the project's success.

## 2. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure, Task 1.3: Storage Service Implementation` in the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Create the IndexedDB wrapper for data persistence that will serve as the foundation for storing and retrieving feedback data in the BackChannel plugin.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Implement IndexedDB initialization and connection management:**

   - Create a storage service module that handles database creation and connection
   - Implement database versioning to support future schema migrations
   - Add connection pooling or reuse to optimize performance
   - Include robust error handling for connection failures

2. **Create CRUD operations for feedback packages and comments:**

   - Implement create, read, update, and delete operations for feedback packages
   - Implement create, read, update, and delete operations for comments
   - Ensure operations are properly typed using the interfaces defined in Task 1.2
   - Add transaction support for operations that affect multiple records

3. **Implement localStorage caching for current feedback package URL and database name:**

   - Create a caching layer using localStorage for the current feedback package URL and database name
   - This caching will allow quick access of the database when opening a new page in the existing document set
   - Implement cache invalidation strategies when data is modified
   - Ensure cache and database stay synchronized

4. **Create utility that seeds JSON data into IndexedDB for testing:**

   - Implement a function to populate the database with test data
   - Follow the structure defined in `docs/project/pre-populate-database.md`
   - Add options to clear existing data before seeding
   - Include verification that data was properly seeded

5. **Add error handling and fallbacks:**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for all database operations
   - Create fallback mechanisms for browsers with limited or no IndexedDB support
   - Add logging for critical errors
   - Ensure errors are properly communicated to the application

## 3. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Define Success:** The storage service implementation will be considered successful when:

- All CRUD operations for feedback packages and comments work correctly
- The localStorage caching layer properly stores and retrieves the current feedback package URL and database name
- The database seeding utility successfully populates test data
- Error handling gracefully manages connection and operation failures
- All code is properly typed with TypeScript and includes comprehensive documentation

**Specify Deliverables:**

1. A storage service module with the following files:

   - `src/services/storage/index.ts` - Main entry point for the storage service
   - `src/services/storage/db.ts` - IndexedDB connection and initialization
   - `src/services/storage/cache.ts` - localStorage caching implementation
   - `src/services/storage/seedData.ts` - Database seeding utility
   - Any additional files needed for complete implementation

2. Unit tests for all storage service functionality:
   - Tests for database initialization
   - Tests for CRUD operations
   - Tests for caching functionality
   - Tests for error handling and fallbacks

## 4. Technical Requirements & Constraints

- **IndexedDB Usage:** Use IndexedDB as the primary storage mechanism
- **localStorage Caching:** Implement localStorage for caching feedback package URL and database name
- **TypeScript:** Ensure all code is properly typed using TypeScript
- **Offline Operation:** The storage service must function without network connectivity
- **Browser Support:** Target recent browsers only, as specified in the project overview
- **Package Management:** Use yarn for any dependencies (as per project requirements)
- **Testing:** Implement Jest tests for all functionality

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's Memory Bank in the appropriate directory: `/Memory/Phase1/Task1.3_Storage_Service_Implementation.md`.

Ensure your log includes:

- A reference to Task 1.3 in the Implementation Plan
- A clear description of the actions taken to implement the storage service
- Key code snippets showing the core functionality
- Any design decisions made during implementation
- Challenges encountered and how they were resolved
- Confirmation of successful execution (passing tests, working functionality)

## 6. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding with implementation.
