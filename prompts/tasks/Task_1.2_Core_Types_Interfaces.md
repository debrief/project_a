# APM Task Assignment: Core Types & Interfaces for BackChannel

## 1. Agent Role & APM Context

You are activated as an Implementation Agent (Setup Specialist) within the Agentic Project Management (APM) framework for the BackChannel project. Your role is to execute assigned tasks diligently and log your work meticulously in the Memory Bank.

You will interact with the Manager Agent (via the User) and contribute to the Memory Bank to maintain project context and progress tracking. Your work is critical to establishing the type system that will underpin the entire BackChannel plugin.

## 2. Onboarding / Context from Prior Work

Task 1.1 (Project Scaffolding) has been successfully completed. The project has been initialized with the following structure:

- TypeScript and Vite have been configured with appropriate settings
- ESLint and Prettier are set up with project-specific rules (including single quotes for JavaScript strings)
- The basic project structure is in place with src/ directory and subdirectories
- Jest and Playwright are configured for testing
- Husky pre-commit and pre-push hooks are configured for code quality

The initial BackChannel class has been implemented in `src/index.ts` with a basic configuration interface:

```typescript
export interface BackChannelConfig {
  targetSelector?: string
  requireInitials?: boolean
  allowExport?: boolean
  storageKey?: string
}
```

The global type definition has been set up in `src/types/global.d.ts` to expose the BackChannel API to the window object.

## 3. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure, Task 1.2: Core Types & Interfaces` in the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Define the TypeScript interfaces and types for the application to ensure type safety and comprehensive documentation.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. Define Comment interface

   - Create a comprehensive interface for feedback comments
   - Include properties for comment text, author, timestamp, element selector, and status
   - Add appropriate JSDoc comments to document each property

2. Define FeedbackPackage interface

   - Create an interface to represent a collection of comments
   - Include properties for package metadata (title, author, creation date)
   - Add a property to store associated comments
   - Document the interface with JSDoc comments

3. Define PageMetadata interface

   - Create an interface to capture metadata about the page being commented on
   - Include properties for URL, title, and any other relevant page information
   - Add JSDoc comments for documentation

4. Create enums for feedback states and modes

   - Define a FeedbackState enum for comment states (e.g., New, Acknowledged, Resolved)
   - Define a PluginMode enum for the plugin modes (Capture, Review)
   - Document each enum value with JSDoc comments

5. Enhance the existing plugin configuration interface

   - Review and expand the BackChannelConfig interface as needed
   - Ensure all configuration options are properly documented

6. Create a types/index.ts file to export all interfaces and types
   - Organize all types in a central location for easy importing
   - Ensure proper export statements for all interfaces and types

## 4. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Define Success:** The task is complete when:

- All required interfaces and types are defined with proper TypeScript typing
- All interfaces and types have comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- The types are organized in a logical structure for easy importing
- The types cover all aspects of the application as described in the Implementation Plan

**Specific Deliverables:**

1. A `types/` directory containing all interfaces and type definitions
2. At minimum, the following type definitions:
   - Comment interface
   - FeedbackPackage interface
   - PageMetadata interface
   - FeedbackState enum
   - PluginMode enum
   - Enhanced BackChannelConfig interface
3. A central export file for all types

## 5. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's Memory Bank in the appropriate location: `/Memory/Phase_1_Setup_Infrastructure/Task_1.2_Core_Types_Interfaces/`.

Adhere strictly to the established logging format as defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`. Ensure your log includes:

- A reference to the assigned task in the Implementation Plan
- A clear description of the actions taken
- Any code snippets generated or modified
- Any key decisions made or challenges encountered
- Confirmation of successful execution (e.g., tests passing, output generated)

## 6. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.

## 7. Technical Requirements

- Follow TypeScript best practices for interface and type definitions
- Use descriptive names and proper casing (PascalCase for interfaces and types, camelCase for properties)
- Include comprehensive JSDoc comments for all interfaces, types, and properties
- Remember that JavaScript strings should be wrapped in single quotes as per project standards
- Ensure all types are properly exported for use throughout the application
- Focus on type safety and comprehensive documentation of interfaces
