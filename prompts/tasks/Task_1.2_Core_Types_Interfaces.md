# APM Task Assignment: Core Types & Interfaces for BackChannel

## 1. Onboarding / Context from Prior Work

Agent: Setup Specialist has successfully completed Task 1.1 (Project Scaffolding), establishing the foundational project infrastructure including:

- Complete TypeScript/Vite build system with ES2015 target for ES5-compatible output
- Comprehensive project directory structure with src/{components,utils,services,types} organized layout
- Initial plugin entry point (src/index.ts) with basic BackChannelPlugin class and global window.BackChannel API
- Working build process generating dist/backchannel.js (1.71 kB) with IIFE format for single-file output
- Functional test suite (Vitest + Playwright) and pre-commit hooks with husky
- Basic TypeScript interfaces already defined in src/types/index.ts including Comment, FeedbackPackage, PageMetadata, PluginConfig, and enums for FeedbackState and CommentStatus

Your current task builds directly upon this foundation by expanding and refining the type definitions to ensure comprehensive type safety for the entire application.

## 2. Task Assignment

**Reference Implementation Plan:** This assignment corresponds to `Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure, Task 1.2: Core Types & Interfaces` in the Implementation Plan.

**Objective:** Define comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and types for the BackChannel application, ensuring type safety and comprehensive documentation of all interfaces.

**Detailed Action Steps:**

1. **Define Comment, FeedbackPackage, and PageMetadata interfaces**
   - Expand the existing Comment interface to include all required fields for feedback capture and review workflows
   - The Comment interface must include: id, elementPath, elementText, commentText, timestamp, optional initials, and optional resolved status
   - Enhance the FeedbackPackage interface to support both capture and review modes with fields for: id, documentTitle, documentUrl, authorName, createdAt, optional urlPrefix, and comments array
   - Refine the PageMetadata interface to include: title, url, and timestamp for cross-page navigation support

2. **Create enums for feedback states and modes**
   - Expand the existing FeedbackState enum to include all plugin operational states (INACTIVE, CAPTURE, REVIEW)
   - Enhance the CommentStatus enum to support resolution workflow with states: PENDING, RESOLVED, REOPENED
   - Add a new PluginMode enum to distinguish between CAPTURE and REVIEW operational modes

3. **Define plugin configuration interface**
   - Expand the existing PluginConfig interface to include all configurable options: requireInitials (boolean), storageKey (string), targetSelector (string), allowExport (boolean)
   - Add new configuration options for: reviewMode (boolean), debugMode (boolean), and autoSave (boolean)
   - Ensure all configuration properties have proper JSDoc documentation explaining their purpose and default values

**Guiding Notes Implementation:**
- Focus on type safety by using strict TypeScript types, avoiding `any` types wherever possible
- Provide comprehensive JSDoc documentation for all interfaces, properties, and enums
- Use union types and optional properties appropriately to support both capture and review workflows
- Ensure interfaces support extensibility for future feature additions
- Include proper type guards and utility types where beneficial for type safety

## 3. Expected Output & Deliverables

**Define Success:** The task is complete when:
- All TypeScript interfaces are properly defined with comprehensive type coverage
- JSDoc documentation is complete for all public interfaces and enums
- The existing plugin code compiles without TypeScript errors
- Type definitions support both capture and review mode workflows
- All interfaces are properly exported from src/types/index.ts

**Specific Deliverables:**
1. Updated src/types/index.ts with expanded and refined interfaces
2. Complete JSDoc documentation for all type definitions
3. Additional utility types or type guards if needed for type safety
4. Updated plugin code (src/index.ts) to use the refined types correctly
5. Verification that yarn build-plugin and yarn test both succeed

## 4. Memory Bank Logging Instructions

Upon successful completion of this task, you **must** log your work comprehensively to the project's Memory Bank in the appropriate location: `/Memory/Phase_1_Setup_Infrastructure/Task_1.2_Core_Types_Interfaces/`.

Adhere strictly to the established logging format as defined in `prompts/02_Utility_Prompts_And_Format_Definitions/Memory_Bank_Log_Format.md`. Ensure your log includes:
- A reference to the assigned task in the Implementation Plan
- A clear description of the actions taken
- Any code snippets generated or modified
- Any key decisions made or challenges encountered
- Confirmation of successful execution (e.g., tests passing, output generated)

## 5. Clarification Instruction

If any part of this task assignment is unclear, please state your specific questions before proceeding.

## 6. Technical Requirements

- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- **Target Environment**: Browser (DOM types available)
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments for all public interfaces
- **File Location**: All types must be defined in src/types/index.ts
- **Export Strategy**: All interfaces and enums must be properly exported
- **Type Safety**: Avoid `any` types, prefer union types and optional properties
- **Compatibility**: Types must support both online and offline operation modes
